I succeded in obtaining a position after two job interviews, I began my working career as a cashier at Dos Coyotes. At first it was a strange adjustment, but throughout the whole experience, I learned a great deal. Many skills were learned during my time at Dos. </p>

One of the very first languages we learned was Scartch. Scratch is a very basic programming language. A project that we had in class for Scratch was creating a game. </p>

                    <p class="card-text"> My family has owned a franchise of Bagel Street Cafe for about 6 years. While working here I learned many skills and lessons, a huge skill I learned was how to deal with customers as well managing people other than myself, becuase I was given the responsibilities of a manger starting at the age of 17. Management and leading a team was a very important and life long skill I will forever have now thanks to this business. Being able to lead people and making compromises is something I am a natural at now. </p>

                        <p class="card-text">In my Computer Science Principal class, we learned how to do image manipulation. We were tasked to manipulate an array of images with coding alone. During this expereience there was a constant need to lean more than what we were given, which resulted in a better understanding of coding. This also taught us the skill to dig deeper for information and how to ask the right question to get the answer we desired. </p>
