                    <p> <strong>Name:</strong> Scratch Project <p>
                    <p> <strong>Duration:</strong> August 30, 2018 - September 9,2018 <p>
                    <p> <strong>Class:</strong> Computer Science Principals <p>
                    <p> <strong>Objective:</strong> Learning basic language of Scratch and exploring the language <p>
                    <p>In my Computer Science Principal class, we are given many opporutunities to learn and explore different programming languages. One of the very first languages we learned was Scartch. Scratch is a very basic programming language. A project that we had in class for Scratch was to work with a partner to create a game. During this project we were pushed to be more creative with whatever we chose to do. We began by brainstorming ideas for the game, we both came to the conclusion of combining the ideas that we had. So we had a multi-layer puzzle. It began with a basic maze and then it was supposed to lead to an escape room where you can interact with the different items within the room. During the project I honed my skills in coding and I even learned how to make a title screen. From the Scratch project I learned how to manage my time because our time was very limited, I learned how to make a goal that was attainable, and lastly I learned how to communicate ideas and proeedures with someone. Though the project may not seem like it helped me towards my goal it really did. Learning new program languages gives me the ability to create my website or any website, to spread the word of new and current non profits that I want to be a part of. I also practices communication skills during the project, because we were allowed to communicate with our partner and groups around us for help or to help. </p>
